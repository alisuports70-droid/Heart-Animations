# ❤️ Heart-Animations (Python Tkinter + Pillow)

A simple but fun project that creates an **animated heart GUI** using Python’s **Tkinter** library for the interface and **Pillow** for image handling.  
This project helped me practice **GUI development, event loops, and basic animation logic** in Python.
